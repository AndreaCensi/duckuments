# Kinematics {#car-kinematics status=draft}

In order to build a model of our Duckiebot we need to start from the kinematics, i.e., understanding how is the motion of the center of mass of the Duckiebot related to its geometry and driving mechanism.

A Duckiebot has two DC motors that independently control the front wheels. By applying different torques to the wheels a Duckiebot can turn, go straight (same torque to both wheels) or stay still (no torque to both wheels). This driving configuration is referred to as _differential drive_.
