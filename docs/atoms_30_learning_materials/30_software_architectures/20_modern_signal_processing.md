## Periodic vs event-based processing

Event-based processing is thus a generalization of periodic processing.

## Design considerations and trade-offs

You need a real-time system to have periodic processing.

Most theoretical results assume periodic processing.


## In Duckietown

Processing loop of line detection. Bounded CPU usage.
