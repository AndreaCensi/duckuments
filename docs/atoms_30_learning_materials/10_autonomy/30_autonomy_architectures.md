## No robot is an island

Difference between a robot and a robotic system

### Components of a robotic system

Components of a robotic system:

- The robot:

  * The hardware
  * The software


- The other robots
- Other machines
- The infrastructure:
    * The network
    * The power
- The people, including
- The supervisor
- The safety operator (e.g. safety driver)

## Modern robotic development

The old model:

* planning
* product development
* integration, with "system integrators"
* installation
* support

Characteristics of new model of development:


Continuous integration and development

* Learning from data, acquired by the robot
* Evaluation

## Example of a modern data

As an example, consider the problem of annotations loops

- The annotators
- The servers for cloud learning
- Regression tests
- Quality control

## Major trade-offs in design

### Centralized vs Distributed

## What we have in Duckietown

- A user interface
