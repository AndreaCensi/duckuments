<div class="check" markdown="1">
Required Reading: The following assumes a working familiarity with 2D and 3D Cartesian coordinate systems. If you are not familiar with Cartesian coordinate systems, please read the [chapter on coordinate systems](#coordinate_systems).
</div>

Discuss:

* Introduction to the notion of *state* as a sufficient statistic that represents the agent (robot) and environment.
* Define notion of *static* and *dynamic* states.
* Provide examples of robot and environment states.

Notes:

* The state should not express information that is not necessary for the task that the robot is performing.

## Preliminaries

Some/all of the following could be simplified or omitted and instead refer readers to reference material.

Discuss basics associated with

* Coordinate systems (moved to preliminaries: [coordinate systems](#coordinate_systems))
* Reference frames
* Transformations

## Robot Representations

Define the notion of:

* *pose* for mobile robots;
* *configuration* for manipulators
* robot and joint velocities

Discuss specific robot state representation for Duckietown.

## Environment Representations

Discuss:

* Difference between topological and metric environment representations;
* Details of topological representation;
* Common metric representations, notably feature-based maps and gridmaps;

### Duckietown Environment Representation

Discuss specific environment representation for Duckietown.
