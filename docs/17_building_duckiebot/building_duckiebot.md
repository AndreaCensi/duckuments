# Building a Duckiebot {#part:building-duckiebot}

The trip begins with acquiring the parts. Here, we provide a link to all bits and pieces that
are needed to build a Duckiebot and the Duckietowns.

In general, keep in mind that:

- The links might expire, or the prices might vary.
- In general, substitutions are OK for the mechanical components,
  and not OK for all the rest.

## Chassis


We selected the Magician Chassis  as the basic chassis for the robot ([](#fig:magician_chassis)).

We chose it because it has a double-decker configuration, and so
we can put the battery in the lower part.

The price for this in the US is about USD 15-30.
