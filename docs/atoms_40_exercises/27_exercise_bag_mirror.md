# Exercise: Images in, mirror image out {#exercise-bag-mirror status=beta}

## Skills learned

* Processing images in a log.

## Instructions

Implement the program `dt-bag-image-op-flip` as in the following specification.

## Bag decimate

The program `dt-bag-image-op-flip` takes as argument a bag filename,
and an output bag file:

    $ dt-bag-image-op-flip "![input bag]" "![output bag]"

The output bag contains the same topics as the input bag, however, if the
topic is an image, the images are flipped around the vertical axis.
