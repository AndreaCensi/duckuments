# Contributing to the documentation {#sec:contribute-to-docs}

## Where the documentation is

All the documentation is in the repository `duckietown/duckuments`.

The documentation is written as a series of small files in Markdown format.

It is then processed by a series of scripts to create this output:

* [a publication-quality PDF][master-pdf];
* [an online HTML version, split in multiple pages and with comments boxes][master-split].

[master-pdf]: http://book.duckietown.org/master/duckiebook.pdf
[master-html]: http://book.duckietown.org/master/duckiebook.html
[master-split]: http://book.duckietown.org/master/duckiebook/index.html
<!-- * [HTML (single-page)][master-html]; -->

## Editing links

The simplest way to contribute to the documentation is to click any of the "âœŽ" icons next to the headers.

They link to the "edit" page in Github. There, one can make and commit the edits in only a few seconds.

## Comments

In the multiple-page version, each page also includes a comment box powered by a service called Disqus. This provides a way for people to write comments with a very low barrier. (We would periodically remove the comments.)

## Installing the documentation system {#installing-docs-system}

In the following, we are going to assume that the documentation system is
installed in `~/duckuments`. However, it can be installed anywhere.

We are also going to assume that you have setup
a Github account with working public keys.

<!-- See: The documentation for that is in XXX. -->

We are also going to assume that you have installed the `duckietown/software` in `~/duckietown`.

### Dependencies (Ubuntu 16.04)

On Ubuntu 16.04, these are the dependencies to install:

    $ sudo apt install libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev
    $ sudo apt install libffi6 libffi-dev
    $ sudo apt install python-dev python-numpy python-matplotlib
    $ sudo apt install virtualenv
    $ sudo apt install bibtex2html pdftk



### Download the `duckuments` repo

Download the `duckietown/duckuments` repository in the `~/duckuments` directory:

    $ git lfs clone --depth 100 git@github.com:duckietown/duckuments duckuments-on-ext4

Here, note we are using `git lfs clone` -- it's much faster, because it downloads
the Git LFS files in parallel.

If it fails, it means that you do not have Git LFS installed. See [](#git-lfs).

The command `--depth 100` tells it we don't care about the whole history.


### Setup the virtual environment

Next, we will create a virtual environment using inside  the `~/duckuments`
directory.

Change into that directory:

    $ cd ~/duckuments

Create the virtual environment using `virtualenv`:

    $ virtualenv --system-site-packages deploy

Other distributions: In other distributions you might need to use `venv` instead of `virtualenv`.

Activate the virtual environment:

    $ source ~/duckuments/deploy/bin/activate

### Setup the `mcdp` external repository

Make sure you are in the directory:

    $ cd ~/duckuments

Clone the `mcdp` external repository, with the branch `duckuments`.

    $ git clone -b duckuments git@github.com:AndreaCensi/mcdp

Install it and its dependencies:

    $ cd ~/duckuments/mcdp
    $ python setup.py develop

Note: If you get a permission error here, it means you have not properly
activated the virtual environment.

Other distributions: If you are not on Ubuntu 16, depending on your system, you might need to install these other dependencies:

    $ pip install numpy matplotlib

You also should run:

    $ pip install -U SystemCmd==2.0.0

## Compiling the documentation

<div class="check" markdown="1">

Make sure you have deployed and activated the virtual environment. You can check
this by checking which `python` is active:

    $ which python
    /home/![user]/duckuments/deploy/bin/python

</div>

Then:

    $ cd ~/duckuments
    $ make duckuments-dist

This creates the directory `duckuments-dist`, which contains
another checked out copy of the repository, but with the branch `gh-pages`, which
is the branch that is published by Github using the "Github Pages" mechanism.

<div class="check" markdown="1">

At this point, please make sure that you have these two `.git` folders:

    ~/duckuments/.git
    ~/duckuments/duckuments-dist/.git

</div>

To compile the docs, run `make clean compile`:

    $ make clean compile

To see the result, open the file

    ./duckuments-dist/master/duckiebook/index.html

### Incremental compilation

If you want to do incremental compilation, you can omit the `clean` and just
use:

    $ make compile

This will be faster. However, sometimes it might get confused. At that point,
do `make clean`.

## Troubleshooting compilation

Symptom: "Invalid XML"

Resolution: "Markdown" doesn't mean that you can put anything in a file. Except
for the code blocks, it must be valid XML. For example, if you use
"<code>&gt;</code>" and "<code>&lt;</code>" without quoting, it will likely
cause a compile error.

Symptom: "Tabs are evil"

Resolution: Do not use tab characters. The error message in this case is quite
helpful in telling you exactly where the tabs are.


Symptom: The error message contains `ValueError: Suspicious math fragment 'KEYMATHS000ENDKEY'`

Resolution: You probably have forgotten to indent a command line by at least 4 spaces. The dollar in the command line is now being confused for a math formula.


## The workflow to edit documentation.

This is the workflow:

1. Edit the Markdown in the `master` branch of the `duckuments` repository.
2. Run `make compile` to make sure it compiles.
3. Commit the Markdown and push on the `master` branch.

Done. A bot will redo the compilation and push the changes in the `gh-pages` branch.

Step 2 is there so you know that the bot will not encounter errors.

## \*Deploying the documentation

Note: This part is now done by a bot, so it has been removed by the documentation.

The book is published to a different [repository called `duckuments-dist`](https://github.com/duckietown/duckuments-dist) and from there
published as `book.duckietown.org`.



<!-- don't need to do it manually.

To deploy the documentation, jump into the `DUCKUMENTS/duckuments-dist` directory.

Run the command `git branch`. If the out does not say that you are on the branch `gh-pages`,
then one of the steps before was done incorrectly.

    $ cd $DUCKUMENTS/duckuments-dist
    $ git branch
    ...
    * gh-pages
    ...

Now, after triple checking that you are in the `gh-pages` branch, you can
use `git status` to see the files that were added or modified,
and simply use `git add`, `git commit` and `git push` to push the files
to Github. -->

## \*Compiling the PDF version

Note: The dependencies below are harder to install. If you don't manage
to do it, then you only lose the ability to compile the PDF. You can do `make compile`
to compile the HTML version, but you cannot do `make compile-pdf`.

### Installing `nodejs`

Ensure the latest version (>6) of `nodejs` is installed.

Run:

    $ nodejs --version
    6.xx

If the version is 4 or less, remove `nodejs`:

    $ sudo apt remove nodejs

Install `nodejs` using [the instructions at this page][nodejs].

[nodejs]: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions

<!-- $ sudo apt install node-less -->

Next, install the necessary Javascript libraries using `npm`:

    $ cd $DUCKUMENTS
    $ npm install MathJax-node jsdom@9.3 less



### Troubleshooting `nodejs` installation problems

The only pain point  in the installation procedure has been the installation of `nodejs` packages using `npm`. For some reason, they cannot be installed globally (`npm install -g`).

Do **not** use `sudo` for installation. It will cause problems.

If you use `sudo`, you probably have to delete a bunch of directories,
such as: `~/duckuments/node_modules`, `~/.npm`, and `~/.node_modules`, if they exist.

### Installing Prince

Install PrinceXML from [this page](https://www.princexml.com/download/).

### Installing fonts
<!--
Download STIX fonts from [this site][stix].

[stix]: https://sourceforge.net/projects/stixfonts/files/latest/download

Unzip and copy the ttf to `~/.fonts`:

    $ cp -R STIXv2.0.0 ~/.fonts -->

Copy the `~/duckuments/fonts` directory in `~/.fonts`:

    $ mkdir -p ~/.fonts    # create if not exists
    $ cp -R ~/duckuments/fonts ~/.fonts

and then rebuild the font cache using:

    $ fc-cache -fv


### Compiling the PDF

To compile the PDF, use:

    $ make compile-pdf

This creates the file:

    ./duckuments-dist/master/duckiebook.pdf
