# Features of the documentation writing system {#sec:documentation-manual}

The Duckiebook is written in a Markdown dialect. A subset of LaTeX is supported.

There are also some additional features that make it possible to create
publication-worthy materials.




## Embedded LaTeX

You can use $\LaTeX$ math, environment, and references. For example, take a look at

\[
    x^2 = \int_0^t f(\tau)\ \text{d}\tau
\]

or refer to [](#prop:example).

\begin{proposition}[Proposition example]\label{prop:example}
This is an example proposition: $2x = x + x$.
\end{proposition}

The above was written as in [](#fig:code).

<pre figure-id="fig:code" figure-caption='Use of LaTeX code.'>
You can use &#36;\LaTeX&#36; math, environment, and references.
For example, take a look at

&#92;[
    x^2 = \int_0^t f(\tau)\ \text{d}\tau
&#92;]

or refer to [](#prop:example).

&#92;begin{proposition}[Proposition example]&#92;label{prop:example}
This is an example proposition: &#36;2x = x + x&#36;.
&#92;end{proposition}
</pre>

TODO: other LaTeX features supported


## LaTeX symbols

The LaTeX symbols definitions are in a file called [`docs/symbols.tex`][symbols].


[symbols]: https://github.com/duckietown/duckuments/blob/master/docs/symbols.tex


Put all definitions there; if they are centralized it is easier to check
that they are coherent.

## Variables in command lines and command output

Use the syntax "<code><span>!</span>[name]</code>" for describing the variables in the code.

<div class="example" markdown="1">

For example, to obtain:

    $ ssh ![robot name].local

Use the following:

<pre><code>
For example, to obtain:

    &#36; ssh <span>!</span>[robot name].local</code>
</pre>

</div>

Make sure to quote (with 4 spaces) all command lines.
Otherwise, the dollar symbol
confuses the LaTeX interpreter.



## Character escapes

Use the string <q><code>&amp;#36;</code></q> to write the dollar symbol <q><code>&#36;</code></q>, otherwise it
gets confused with LaTeX math materials. Also notice that you should probably
use "USD" to refer to U.S. dollars.

Other symbols to escape are shown in [](#tab:escapes).

<col2 figure-id="tab:escapes" figure-caption="Symbols to escape">
    <s>use <code>&amp;#36;</code> </s> <s>instead of <code>&#36;</code></s>
    <s>use <code>&amp;#96;</code> </s> <s>instead of <code>&#96;</code></s>
    <s>use <code>&amp;#lt;</code> </s> <s>instead of <code>&lt;</code></s>
    <s>use <code>&amp;#gt;</code> </s> <s>instead of <code>&gt;</code></s>
</col2>


## Keyboard keys

Use the `kbd` element for keystrokes.

<div class="example" markdown="1">

For example, to obtain:

> Press <kbd>a</kbd> then <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>C</kbd>.

use the following:

    Press <kbd>a</kbd> then <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>C</kbd>.

</div>

## Figures

For any element, adding an attribute called `figure-id`
with value `fig:![figure ID]` or `tab:![table ID]`
will create a figure that wraps the element.


For example:

    <div figure-id="fig:![figure ID]">
        ![figure content]
    </div>

It will create HMTL of the form:

    <div id='fig:code-wrap' class='generated-figure-wrap'>
        <figure id='fig:![figure ID]' class='generated-figure'>
            <div>
                ![figure content]
            </div>
        </figure>
    </div>

<!--
To add a class to the figure, use `figure-class`:

    <div figure-id="fig:code" figure-class="myclass">
        ![figure content]
    </div>

This will give it to the <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> and the containing <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code>


Useful classes:

* `float_bottom`

-->

To add a caption, add an attribute `figure-caption`:

    <div figure-id="fig:![figure ID]" figure-caption="This is my caption">
        ![figure content]
    </div>

Alternatively, you can put anywhere an element `figcaption` with ID `![figure id]:caption`:

    <element figure-id="fig:![figure ID]">
        ![figure content]
    </element>

    <figcaption id='fig:![figure ID]:caption'>
        This the caption figure.
    </figcaption>

To refer to the figure, use an empty link:

    Please see [](#fig:![figure ID]).

The code will put a reference to "Figure XX".



## Shortcut for tables

The shortcuts `col2`, `col3`, `col4`, `col5`
are expanded in tables with 2, 3, 4 or 5 columns.

The following code:

<pre>
<code>
&lt;col2 figure-id="tab:mytable" figure-caption="My table"&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/col2&gt;
</code>
</pre>

gives the following result:

<col2 figure-id="tab:mytable" figure-caption="My table">
    <span>A</span>
    <span>B</span>
    <span>C</span>
    <span>D</span>
</col2>

### `labels-row1`  and `labels-row1`

Use the classes `labels-row1`  and `labels-row1` to make pretty tables like the following.

<col3 figure-id="tab:mytable-col1" class="labels-col1">
    <figcaption>Using <code>class="labels-col1"</code></figcaption>
    <span>A</span>
    <span>B</span>
    <span>C</span>
    <span>D</span>
    <span>E</span>
    <span>F</span>
    <span>G</span>
    <span>H</span>
    <span>I</span>
</col3>

<col3 figure-id="tab:mytable-row1" class="labels-row1">
    <figcaption>Using <code>class="labels-row1"</code></figcaption>
    <span>A</span>
    <span>B</span>
    <span>C</span>
    <span>D</span>
    <span>E</span>
    <span>F</span>
    <span>G</span>
    <span>H</span>
    <span>I</span>
</col3>


## Troubleshooting

Symptom: "Invalid XML"

Resolution: "Markdown" doesn't mean that you can put anything in a file. Except
for the code blocks, it must be valid XML. For example, if you use "&gt;" and
"&lt;" without quoting, it will likely cause a compile error.

Symptom: "Tabs are evil"

Resolution: Do not use tab characters. The error message in this case is quite
helpful in telling you exactly where the tabs are.


Symptom: The error message contains `ValueError: Suspicious math fragment 'KEYMATHS000ENDKEY'`

Resolution: You probably have forgotten to indent a command line by at least 4 spaces. The dollar in the command line is now being confused for a math formula.
