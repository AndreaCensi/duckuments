## Where the documentation is

All the documentation is in the repository duckietown/duckuments.

The documentation is written as a series of small files in Markdown format.

It is then processed by a series of scripts to create this output:

* [a publication-quality PDF][master-pdf];
* [an online HTML version, split in multiple pages and with comments boxes][master-split].

[master-pdf]: https://duckietown.github.io/duckuments/master/duckiebook.pdf
[master-html]: https://duckietown.github.io/duckuments/master/duckiebook.html
[master-split]: https://duckietown.github.io/duckuments/master/duckiebook/index.html
<!-- * [HTML (single-page)][master-html]; -->

## Editing links

The simplest way to contribute to the documentation is to click any of the “✎” icons next to the headers.

They link to the “edit” page in Github. There, one can make and commit the edits in only a few seconds.
     
## Comments

In the multiple-page version, each page also includes a comment box powered by a service called Disqus. This provides a way for people to write comments with a very low barrier. (We would periodically remove the comments.)

## Compiling the documentation
