# Duckietown Git conventions {#git-conventions}

Assigned: Liam?

These are the conventions for the `Software` repository.

## Branches

The `master` branch is always "green": the continuous integration tests pass.


## Pushing to `master`

It is not possible to push on to the master branch directly.

What you need to do is work on your branch, push that branch, and then merge your work using a pull request.

Github will let you merge the pull request only if the tests pass.


See: [Github documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-merges/).
