# Slack {#slack}

When you accept your Slack invite, please follow these rules in setting up your profile:

- username = last name
- first name = first name
- last name = last name (institution/location)

<div class='example-usage' markdown="1">
Here is an example: Andrea Censi from ETHZ is `@censi`, his name on Slack is "Andrea Censi (ETHZ)".
</div>

Please add a picture (relatively professional, so that we can use it for rosters when the time comes.)

## Installing the Slack app on Linux

## Disabling Slack email notifications

Most importantly, please take the time to disable email notification for Slack.

The point of Slack is that you don't get email. You can work on Duckietown
only when you have the time to do so.

## Disabling Slack pop-up notification on the desktop

Also remove pop up notifications from the app. It should be a discrete notification that says "hey, when you have some time, look at Twist", not "HEY HEY HEY PAY ATTENTION TO ME NOW".
