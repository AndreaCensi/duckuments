## Duckietown setup notes 

The Duckietown used for this demo needs to have the following characteristics: 

* Three or four way intersection tiles
* The intersections must be provided with two signs that have to be clearly visible: 1) The intersection type (stop sign or traffic light), 2)intersection topology. Traffic light if needed.


## Duckiebot setup notes 

No special setup is needed for the Duckiebot. If more Duckiebots are available, they should be used too since the demo is about coordination and LED emission and detection.
