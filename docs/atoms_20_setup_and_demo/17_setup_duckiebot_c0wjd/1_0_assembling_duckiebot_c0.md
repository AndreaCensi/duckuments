# Part A - Assembling the car - bottom part
Open the Duckiebox package (magician chassis – DG007), and you won’t need them all. Take out the following materials:
* Chassis-bottom, Chassis-up (1+1 pieces)
* Motor (2 pieces), motor holders (4 pieces)
* Wheels (2 pieces), Omni wheel (1 pieces)
* all Spacers and screw inside of the packages. Screwdriver (1x)

## 1. Motor + chassis bottom
Insert motor holders on the chassis-bottom and put the motors as below (with the longest screws M3*30 and M3 nuts). Ignore the speed board holder in the image.

_**Note 1**: Orient the motors so that its wires are inward (toward the center of the chassis-bottom) and the black wires are closer to the chassis-bottom. This makes wiring easier later._

_**Note 2**: if your Magician Chassis package has unsoldered motor wires, you will have to solder them first. Check these instructions [make instructions for soldering motor wires]. In this case, your wires will not have the male pin headers on one end. Do not worry, you can still plug them in the stepper motor hat power terminals._


## 2. Assemble the wheels
Plug in the wheels to the motor as follows (no screws needed):
