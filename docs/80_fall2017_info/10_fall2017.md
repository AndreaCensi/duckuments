# General remarks


## The rules of Duckietown

**The first rule of Duckietown**

The first rule of Duckietown is: you don't talk about Duckietown, *using email*.

Instead, we use a communication platform called Slack.

There is one exception: inquiries about "meta" level issues, such as course
enrollment and other official bureaucratic issues can be communicated via email.

**The second rule of Duckietown**

The second rule of Duckietown is: be kind and respectful, and have
fun.

**The third rule of Duckietown**

The third rule of Duckietown is: read the instructions carefully.

Do not blindly copy and paste.

Only run a command if you know what it does.




## Synchronization between classes

At ETHZ, UdeM, TTIC, the class will be more-or-less synchronized. The materials
are the same; there is some slight variation in the ordering.

Moreover, there will be some common groups for the projects.

The NCTU class is undergraduate level. Students will learn slightly simplified materials. They will not collaborate directly with the classes.
