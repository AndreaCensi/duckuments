## Byobu

You need to learn to use `byobu`. It will save much time later.

Byobu is "GNU `screen`" with fancy configuration; if you know `screen`,
that's fine as well.

Please learn about Byobu here:

- [http://byobu.co/](http://byobu.co/)

Install using:

    $ sudo apt install byobu

### Advantages of using Byobu

### Quick command reference

Quick commands reference, using function keys:

- `F2`: open a new terminal.
- `F3`/`F4`: switch among the terminals.
- `Ctrl-F6`: close current terminal.

Using control sequences:

- `ctrl-A` then `C`: creates new terminal.
- `ctrl-A` then a number: switches to that terminal.
- `ctrl-A` then `D`: detaches the terminal.

To quit a terminal, just use `exit`.

<!-- Shift+<arrow keys> switches between panes. Shift+Alt+<arrow keys> changes the current pane size. -->

<!-- Byobu tips: don't forget F2 (or ctrl-a C) in byobu will open a terminal in a new tab. Alternatively, you can also Shift+F2 to split the current tab into two horizontally. -->
