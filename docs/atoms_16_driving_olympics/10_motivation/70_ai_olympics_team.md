\subsection{Organizing team}

%Provide a short biography of all team members, stressing their competence for their assignments in the competition organization.  Where possible, provide confirmation from the organizer's employer supporting their academic service in organizing the competition.

The organizing team comprises 5 universities (ETH Zürich, University of Montréal, Georgia Tech, National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan, Tsinghua University, China) and 3 companies: a self-driving car company (nuTonomy), a cloud company (Amazon AWS), and a startup (Rerobots) working on remote access to robotic platforms.
