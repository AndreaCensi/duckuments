# Setup the laptops

## Setup an Ubuntu laptop to ssh to the duckiebot

Connect your laptop to the same network as the robot.

From your laptop, now you should be able to ping the duckiebot:

	laptop $ ping ROBOTNAME.local

(or if you have not changed your hostname then ROBOTNAME=duckiebot)

Do not continue if you cannot do this successfully. 

**_Protip_***: In general, if you find yourself:*

* *typing an IP*

* *typing a password*

* *typing "ssh" more than once*

* *using a screen / USB keyboard *

*it means you should learn more about Linux and networks, and you are setting yourself up for failure. Yes, you "can do without", but with an additional 30 seconds of your time. The 30 seconds you are not saving every time are the difference between being productive roboticists and going crazy. Really, it is impossible to do robotics when you have to think about IPs and passwords... *

Verify that you can ssh to the PI:

laptop $ ssh ubuntu@duckiebot.local 

Say "yes" if you get asked whether you want to add it to a list of known hosts.

**Offending key error:** If you get something like this:

Warning: the ECDSA host key for ... differs from the key for the IP address '10.0.1.17'

Offending key for IP in /Users/<user>/.ssh/known_hosts:<line>

then remove line <line> in ~/.ssh/known_hosts

Now, letâ€™s set up **passwordless ssh.**

On the laptop, create the .ssh directory:

	laptop $ mkdir -p ~/.ssh

Install the duckietown_key1 by downloading it:

laptop $ wget -O ~/.ssh/duckietown_key1 "https://www.dropbox.com/s/q23qptu01u7ur3y/duckietown_key1?dl=1"

**Changing Key Permission **

Edit the permission of the file to make ssh happy. The key file must not be readable or writable from other users or groups.

**1**

laptop $ 

chmod 600 ~/.ssh/duckietown_key1

chmod 600 ~/.ssh/duckietown_key1

Regenerate the public key according to:za

laptop $ ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/duckietown_key1 -y > ~/.ssh/duckietown_key1.pub

**Troubleshooting**

If there are issues such as "scheme missing" and the file duckietown_key1 does not exist in ~/.ssh/ folder but instead downloaded a file named duckietown_key1?dl=1 in the current folder simply rename duckietown_key1?dl=1 to duckietown_key1 and copy it over to the directory ~/.ssh/. 

To move the mislabeled file:

	laptop $ mv "duckietown_key1?dl=1"  ~/.ssh/duckietown_key1

On the laptop, now edit  ~/.ssh/config:

laptop $ nano ~/.ssh/config

and add the following lines:

	Host **ROBOTNAME**
		Hostname ROBOTNAME.local
		User ubuntu
		IdentityFile ~/.ssh/duckietown_key1
		HostKeyAlgorithms ssh-rsa

Now you should be able to ssh passwordlessly from your laptop:

	laptop $ ssh **duckiebot**

This should succeed. Do not continue unless it does.

Note that you can actually auto-complete with tab after ssh.
