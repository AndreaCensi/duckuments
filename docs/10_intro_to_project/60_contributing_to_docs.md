# Contributing to this documentation

## Where the documentation is

All the documentation is in the repository [duckietown/duckuments][repo].

[repo]: https://github.com/duckietown/duckuments

The documentation is written as a series of small files in Markdown format.

The output is:

- a publication-quality PDF;
- HTML (single-page);
- HTML (multiple pages).


## Editing links

The simplest way to contribute to the documentation is
to click any of the "âœŽ" icons next to the headers.

They link to the "edit" page in Github. There, one can make and commit the edits in only a few seconds.

## Comments

In the multiple-page version, each page also includes a comment box
powered by a service called Disqus. This provides a way for people
to write comments with a very low barrier. (We would periodically remove the comments.)

## Compiling the documentation

TODO: Write instructions - it's "make all" but the dependencies
are complicated.

## Embedded LaTeX

You can use $\LaTeX$ math, environment, and references.

For example, take a look at \eqref{eq:one}

$$
    x^2 = \int_{0}^{t} f(\tau) \text{d}\tau, \label{eq:one}
$$

or refer to \prettyref{prop:example}.

\begin{proposition}[Proposition example]\label{prop:example}
This is an example proposition.
\end{proposition}
