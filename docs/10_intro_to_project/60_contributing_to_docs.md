# Contributing to this documentation

## Where the documentation is

All the documentation is in the repository duckietown/duckuments.

The documentation is written as a series of small  files in Markdown format. The output is:

* a publication-quality PDF;
* HTML (single-page);
* HTML (multiple pages).

## Editing links

The simplest way to contribute to the documentation is to click any of the “✎” icons next to the headers.

They link to the “edit” page in Github. There, one can make and commit the edits in only a few seconds.

## Comments

In the multiple-page version, each page also includes a comment box powered by a ser- vice called Disqus. This provides a way for people to write comments with a very low barrier. (We would periodically remove the comments.)

## Compiling the documentation

TODO: Write instructions - it’s “make all” but the dependencies are complicated.

## Deploying the documentation
