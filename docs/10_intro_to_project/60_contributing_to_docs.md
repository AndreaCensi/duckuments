# Contributing to this documentation

## Where the documentation is

All the documentation is in the repository [duckietown/duckuments][repo].

[repo]: https://github.com/duckietown/duckuments

It is written in a series of small files in Markdown format.

Some magic code reads them and assembles them into this book.

## Editing links

The simplest way to contribute to the documentation is
to click any of the "âœŽ" icons next to the headers.

They link to the "edit" page in Github. There, one
can make and commit the edits in only a few seconds.

## Compiling the new version

TODO: Write instructions - it's "make all" but the dependencies
are complicated.

## Feature: embedded LaTeX

You can use $\LaTeX$ math, environment, and references.

For example, take a look at \eqref{eq:one}

$$
    x^2 = \int_{0}^{t} f(\tau) \text{d}\tau, \label{eq:one}
$$

or refer to \prettyref{prop:example}.

\begin{proposition}[Proposition example]\label{prop:example}
This is an example proposition.
\end{proposition}
