# Accounts {#sec:accounts}

## Complete list of accounts

Currently, Duckietown has the following accounts:

* Github
* Slack
* Twist: to  be used for instructors coordination.
* Google Drive: to be used for instructors coordination, maintaining TODOs, etc.
* Dropbox Folders (part of Andrea's personal accounts): to be abandoned.
* Vimeo, for storing the videos
* The `duckietown-teaching` mailing list, for low-rate communication with instructors.
* We also have a list of addresses, of people signed up on the website, that we didn't use yet.
* The Facebook page

We have to decide about issue tracking - (leaning towards Github).

## For Fall 2017

As a student in Fall 2017, these are the accounts that you need:

- A Github account and membership of the Duckietown organization.
- A Slack account, for team discussion and organization.
- Dropbox: we will have 1 account that can be shared for uploading files (movies, logs). It is not necessary to install the Dropbox client on ones computer or to download all the files.

As an instructor/TA for the Fall 2017 class, in addition to the accounts above, these are the accounts that you need:

- Twist: for class organization;
- Google Docs, used to maintain TODOs.
